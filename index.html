        <p style="
    margin: 0% 0 1% 0%;">I've been programming for about 3 years now. I started programming because of Discord, more specifically the people I met on there
     who introduced me to programming. Initially started by making a shit Discord bot with Node.JS, then went to Java and back end devlopment, and lastly
     learned some web development.
     </p> <br/> <p>
     As for photography, it's a nice hobby and I enjoy doing some photography from time to time,
      especially when visiting new places. I also like gaming and mostly play
    competitive games, but I also like story and cozy games.</p>

        <p >As for proffessional experience/actually having had a job, well I have none.
            I've been programming for about 3 years now and have learned some back end and front end development. 
            Over time, I've become decent at the main programming languages I've used like Java, MySQL, HTML and CSS.
            But I'm still trying to learn more and so currently I'm trying to learn JavaScript.
