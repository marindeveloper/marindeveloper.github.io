    <div class="about">
        <h2 style="margin: 0% 0% 1% 0%;">About me</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0% 0 1% 0%;">I've been programming for about 3 years now. I started programming because of Discord, more specifically the people I met on there
            who introduced me to programming. Initially started by making a shit Discord bot with Node.JS, then went to Java and back end devlopment, and lastly
            learned some web development.
            </p> <br/> <p>
            As for photography, it's a nice hobby and I enjoy doing some photography from time to time, especially when visiting new places. I also like gaming and mostly play
           competitive games, but I also like story and cozy games.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="experience">
        <h2 style="margin: 0% 0 1% 0%;">Experience</h2>
        <p>As for proffessional experience/actually having had a job, well I have none.
            I've been programming for about 3 years now and have learned some back end and front end development. 
            Over time, I've become decent at the main programming languages I've used like Java, HTML, CSS and rarely some MySQL but I haven't touched that in a while.
            Though, I'm still trying to learn more and so currently I'm learning JavaScript, already made a couple of projects using it, check them out on my github :D</p>

        <div class="projects">
            <h2 style="margin: 0% 0 1% 0%;">Projects</h2>
            <p>Over the years I've made quite a lot of projects, a lot of them are either shit/not worth putting on here. BUT, recently, after like 6 months I started to get back into programming, started making some cool projects that sparked my interests or that I think are pretty good. Here they are:</p>
    
            
        <div class="project">

                max-width: 600px;
                font-weight:400;"> - simulates a specified no. of cases</span></button>
            <div class="project-details">
                <p>Simulates a user-inputted number of cases opened and says the amount of each rarity you got, how much money it costed, an approximate total value of those items and a profit/loss stat based on the approximate total value and money spent. Made in JS, HTML and CSS.</p>
