        <h2 style="margin: 0% 0% 1% 0%;">About me</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0% 0 1% 0%;">I like programming, photography, and exploring new things. I've been programming for about 3 years now. I started programming because of Discord, more specifically the people I met on there
            who introduced me to it. Initially started by making a pretty bad Discord bot with Node.JS, then went to Java and back end devlopment, and lastly
            learned some web development.
            </p> <br/> <p>
            As for photography, it's a nice hobby and I enjoy doing some photography from time to time, especially when visiting new places. I also like gaming and I mostly play competitive games, 
            but I also enjoy story-driven and cozy games.</p>

             font-weight:400;"> So, about experience... yeah, haven't had a real job yet lol. BUT, I've been programming for about 3 years now and have learned some back end and front end development. 
            Over time, I've become decent at the main languages I've used like Java, HTML, CSS and rarely some MySQL but I haven't touched that in a while.
            Though, I'm still trying to learn more and so currently I'm learning JavaScript, already made a couple of projects using it, check them out on </span>

            <p>Over the years I've made quite a few projects, and some of them I wouldn't really put on here. BUT, recently, after like 6 months I started getting back into programming and made some projects that sparked my interests or that I think are pretty good. Here they are:</p>
