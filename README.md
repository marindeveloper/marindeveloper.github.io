# Personal Website :D
Yep, you read that right, just my personal website. Nothing too crazy, just a place to put my stuff and some info, also a pretty fun project to do every half a year or so lol. <br/>

Check it out at: [marindeveloper.github.io/](https://marindeveloper.github.io/) (it's mobile friendly btw, unlike everything I used to make before lol)<br/>
Also check out my other projects on github (yes this is a self promo now)
