# Personal Website :D
Yep, you read that right, just my personal website. Nothing too crazy, just a place to put my stuff and some info, also a pretty fun project to do every half a year or so lol. <br/> 

Check it out at: [marindeveloper.github.io/](https://marindeveloper.github.io/) (it's mobile friendly, unlike most of the stuff I make, though the github chart looks a little small on mobile)<br/>
Also check out my other projects on github (yes this is a self promo now)
